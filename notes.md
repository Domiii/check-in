# Basics

## Goal
1. Define what is a great mentor, and act accordingly
1. Develop specific "Program Modules" to aid people in their (very own journey) from different places A to specific places B
1. SDL: Allow learner to design and follow up on their own learning journey; while aiding them in the process

## Mentoring/Coaching Consideratinos
* TODO?
* Very incomplete list of considerations: https://exercism.io/mentoring-faqs

## Modules
* Programming/Engineering/CT...
  1. Core (Hard skills)
  1. Mindset (Soft skills, attitudes)
  TODO: align a bit with CT definitions as they already laid some of the concepts out

(Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced?)


## Purpose
1. "a meaningful and beautiful guide on your learning journey"
   * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3PpphdrEmU
1. help user understand their own programming-related learner needs by their needs explicitely (questions and decision making)
1. Provide choices and help visualize the different paths and possibilities for each user(?)


# Recommendations on programming/CT learning

## Principles
1. SDL + learn to learn
   1. You are in charge
   1. Start understanding your own learning process
   1. don't rely on an outside authority to tell you what to do
   1. You can choose to go at full speed ahead
1. Learner engages in goal setting
   1. You can set goals, you can choose not to
   1. Beginner level:
      1. engage in goal setting together with mentor/coach
      1. Try to listen in on other goal setting discussions?
   1. Recommendation: If not explicitely setting goals, at least reflect on your process and see if being more explicit can be helpful, or if you are engaging without any
   1. Exploration can also be a goal
1. Engaging in problem solving
   1. Get your hands dirty; write code; solve stuff
1. Focus, Practice + Mastery?
   * (is up to you)

## Activity Checklist
* Embrace the basics + foundational concepts
* Work on a real-world codebase, e.g.:
   * Open source case studies
   * Internship
*. Mentor sharing sessions
   * A bit like frontal instruction of a concept/explanation that the mentor cares about
   * Anyone can join/leave at their own leisure


## Cohort participation problems + recommendations
1. Passive students
   1. Walk around, don't always just sit in your corner
   1. Engage with coach
   1. Engage with peers?
1. No celebration of achievement
   1. Enjoy your achievements
   1. Share the good shit
   1. Engage in a positive motivational feedback cycle
1. 自卑, students don't voice their concerns, frustrations and resort to blame instead
   1. Speak out when you feel frustration or helplessness; don't blame yourself?

## Mindset
1. Nonviolence
   * Overcoming judgementalism
   * Overcoming anger
   * Overcoming dishonesty
   * Knowing and communicating on our own "hidden agendas" (what is it that we really want to get out of our actions?)
1. Playfulness (life's a game after all)
1. Overcoming Fear and Apathy
1. Overcoming/preventing Anxiety and Burn-out

## Goal setting + SDL
* Goal mode vs. exploratory mode
* Relaxed mode vs. go-hard mode

# Learner skills
* Reading and information absorption

# Idea corner: L2L + soft skills

## Flow: Comfort vs. Challenge
* Apathy, fear and everything that is in the way
* Comfort Zone (i.e. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=618eR-1zdoY) 
* "Failure mentality"?
  * Programming is all about failing... won't get through it without it...
* degree of difficulty?
  * head -> table?
    * walls, problems, despair, frustration, failure
  * sense of accomplishment
    * seeing the light, warmth, growth?

## Sources of comfort
* Motivation
  * Social Motivation
  * Project
  * Pressure/punishment avoidance, and other extrinsic motivators?
* Energy/Sleep
* Focus
  * Decluttering your life
  * (Meditation?)
  * Keeping on going once started (investing when following flow?)
* Mastery (having the basics down?)
* Sense of achievement
* Other?

## sense of direction, choices, decisions
* meaning and purpose
* "I chose to do this" vs. "they told me to so I did it" vs. "that's just how I do it"
* "you have a choice to go from auto-pilot to decision maker."


## Concept practice vs. project work?

## list of relevant resources?

## learning path guidelines?
* start putting things to use and produce something visible to the world on week #2
* challenges: easy, intermediate, advanced
* learner supplements: easy, intermediate, advanced
* categories:
  * programming concepts (more scaffolded; online classes; new concepts + theory?)
  * programming concept practice (small challenges; produce (simple?) output; compare solutions)
  * project practice (reverse engineering; build to spec; compare solutions)
  * project work (build your own thing)

## real-world connection?
  * internships + job
  * open source contributions
  * competitions
  * your own dream project?


## learner logs
* keep track of the main things you did
  * weekly goal and/or progress
* concept log
  * what are some of the things you did?
  * "vocabulary practice" <-> "throwback x-day" - looking back at a concept and finding its purpose (again)?

## self-assessment
* real focus?
  * TODO: what does that mean?
* time invested (focussed vs. non-focussed?)
* time enjoyed (focussed vs. non-focussed?)

## communications + discussions
* sharing
* semi-regular blitz presentations
  * learner log: two very clear pages to talk about a single simple concept
    * (and how its connected to other concepts?)
    * (can have more but only for reference)
  * progress log: ???
* more interactions with other people?


## Task tracking?
1. Puts us in control (we are in charge of our own agenda!)
1. What gets measured gets managed
1. Careful: Over-managing causes fatigue and general "shittiness"
1. TODO: Task engagement, focus + attitude


# More Features?
* Take a regular, short (audio or video) tape of yourself, reflecting your own learning
  * TODO: why?
* System questions support your creation thereof
* end goal: analyze and scaffold your own learning
