I am a music editor and do not use any DJ programs, but instead, I use editing software to make my compilations.  I have edited all of the tracks to some degree (adjusting sound levels, shortening hooks, adjusting tempo, etc.) and even made instrumentals out of songs that did not have instrumental versions available.  I then apply a simple crossfade to make a transition between tracks. I like to also include instrumentals at certain points during the compilation to fit as many songs in and add to the overall atmosphere of that year, and as a freestyle break.
